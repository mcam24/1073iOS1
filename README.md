Three Facts About Me

*   I enjoy doing web design and development and hope to make a career out of it
*   I'm into a lot of things ranging from fitness and sports to video games and books

I'm using github, which means that the changes that I make in this file, once I commit and push them, will be visible on the main page of this repo. 

Yep. This is a change.
